Before you report a bug, please be sure to be on the latest version of the pack,
also I want to be clear that Optifine is not supported, so please remove it and report the bug only if the problem still exists.

Also be sure when you report the bug - if it's a crash - to provide a gist or pastebin link to the crash log.

Known bugs that you don't need to report:

- JEI shows removed recipes from Calculator and Forestry and doesn't show added Metal Former and Macerator recipes from IC2
- TechReborn bugs #954, #955, #962 (see https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn/issues)
