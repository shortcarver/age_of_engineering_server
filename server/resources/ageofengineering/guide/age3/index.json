  "The next goal is to get the Empowerer from Actually Additions. It needs a battery from Actually Additions which itself needs a battery (Energy Module) from Calculator (For some the battery recipe doesn't work for some weird reason, charging the Energy Module with a little bit of RF fixes it though). But to get Purified Coal (a fuel with a better burn rate) you need to grow Prunae Seeds (they grow the Coal Dust you need). Those can only be planted with a Greenhouse, but only the Basic Greenhouse can be crafted at this point in time. To craft the Basic Greenhouse you need 4 kind of different nature products: 1.) Peat from Bog Earth which is placed next to water (within a range of 2 blocks) 2.) Prunae Seeds themselves which you can craft from Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds and Coal Coke with a Calculator 3.) Crystallized Canola Seeds which you get from lasering Canola Seeds with the Atomic Reconstructor 4.) Industrial Hemp Seeds which you can get from breaking grass. To activate the Greenhouse you have to supply it with power and the materials shown in the GUI. Now you have basic automatic farming and can grow Prunae Seeds.",

  "To set the Empowerer up, you also need 4 Display Stands placed on the 4 ends of the Empowerer 3 blocks away and provided with power. The blocks you get through the Atomic Reconstructor can be empowered. Be aware that those need a lot of power, a lot more than usual (the Crystal Blocks need several Million RF). You can for now make 3 out of the 6 empowered blocks: Restonia, Palis and Void Crystal; for the other 3 you need to craft the Thermal Centrifuge.",

  "Now you can make IC2 Advanced Circuits which enables you to make advanced tools and machines like the Mining Laser and the Thermal Centrifuge which combined with the Ore Washing Plant gives you higher output from your ores and gives you the option to build a Nuclear Reactor. Also you can make the Algorithm Separator from Calculator so that you can make a lot more machines like the Advanced Greenhouse and the Starch Extractor (40 RF/t) which generates power from fuel and Wheat. You can also upgrade the Advanced Greenhouse to the Actually Additions Farmer or the Garden Cloches. You're now also able to generate power from the 4 different kinds of Oil (max 350 RF/t) that Actually Additions adds using the Canola Press, Fermenting Barrel and Oil Generator, as well as other Actually Additions Generators like the Leaf-Eating Generator (50 RF/t), the Bio Reactor (max 256 RF/t) and the Solar Panel (8 RF/t). Mentioning Solar Panel, you can now also craft Solar Panels II. Another thing you can do is getting started with Grid Power from ExtraUtils2, using it for automating or using one of the many different generators. Another way to auto mine resources also opened up, the Vertical Digger."
