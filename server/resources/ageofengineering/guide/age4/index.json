  "Also you can start Forestry now. The Sturdy Casing is needed for basically all machines and can be crafted in the Empowerer for 2 M RF. (Side note: to be able to get the achievement and trophy for ages 4-6, be sure to drop and pickup the item) With the Thermionic Fabricator you're are now able to make Multifarms. The Tubes need Redstone Ingots and Thickened Glass while the Fabricator itself needs Clear Glass from EnvironmentalTech (the easier recipe is disabled). If you want to change the farms you need Circuit Boards. For that you need Calculator Circuit Processing (the easier recipe is disabled as well). The Extraction Chamber extracts circuits with a chance of 12.5% from Dirt or Cobblestone. Later you can use the Precision Chamber for a 100% chance. Damaged Circuits get repaired in the Reassembly Chamber while Dirty Circuits get cleaned in the Restoration Chamber. The Processing Chamber can do both, but is also not available yet. Then the Circuits need to be analyzed in the Analysing Chamber which needs no power and gets you some byproducts. Some circuits may turn out stable. You can then store the analyzed Circuits in the Storage Chamber which you can craft later. The Circuits for the Circuit Boards need to be exactly the same which means same texture, analyzed and not stable. To automate those machines you can use the PA Wrench to change the color of the block sides which match the color of the slots the GUI.",

  "You should also start Bee and Tree Breeding as you need it later. If you are new to bee breeding reading wikis or youtube tutorials are recommended. You basically should work towards an Alveary which means Industrious and Imperial Bees. Those bees all need Normal Temperature and Humidity and only work during the day, so the perfect spot to mutate them is in the Mining Dimension which you can access from wherever you settled. Also, if you have Imperial Bees you have access to the Mutating Frames from More Bees. 3 of them guarantee a mutation for most bee species. The other two frames are for more production and are better than the normal Forestry ones. For example 3 of the Super Cooled Frames are 4 times as good as an Apiary, but you need access to Icy Bees and a healthy supply of Copper. Tree Breeding is especially nice for Seed Oil, working towards Cherry and Nut trees should be your first goal."
