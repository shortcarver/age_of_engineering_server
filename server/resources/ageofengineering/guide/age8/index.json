  "With Iridium you can now unlock the rest of Calculator. You should make an Atomic Calculator and then a Flawless Calculator. This enables you to make a more efficient Circuit Production and a Circuit Storage. Also you can now create passive power with the Conductor Mast or the Calculator Locator w/ Plugs (you need Plutonium for that). Tip: Investing in making a Diamond Sapling should pay off really fast. Unlocking End Diamonds you can now make the NeoTech Elite Solar Panel (256 RF/t) and SolarFluxReborn Solar Panel IV (128 RF/t) and V (512 RF/t). Given you gathered Mica from the EnvironmentalTech Void Resource Miner you can now also make Tier 3 EnvironmentalTech Multiblocks. You have as well now the option to build an Extreme Reactor, be aware that those need Plutonium and Graphite Electrodes."
