  "The next tech mod is EnderIO. For the machine chassis you need the Carpenter and a lot of Seed Oil which you should easily squeeze from the seeds from your farms. Speaking of farms, with EnderIO you can now craft a Farming Station as well Spawners, better item and power transportation, the Inventory Panel which runs on Nutrient Distillation and a lot of new power options with the Stirling, Combustion and Zombie Generators.",

  "You can now unlock more Solar Panels, like the Solar Panel III and the Advanced Solar Panel. Also you can now craft the Heavy Engineering Block, so that you can go for BioDiesel power (4096 RF/t) or for example for the Excavator. You should also start now getting into EnvironmentalTech as both the Void Resource Miner as well the Void Ore Miner are required for future progression. The Solar Panel and the Lightning Rod are also both nice for power generation. EnvironmentalTech has an in-game manual, the Digital Guide, if you want to read more about it.",

  "Before you can progress, if you haven't done it already, you have to go to the End. You have no way to get a Jetpack yet as all of them need an Elytra, which is one goal for going to the End. But it is recommended to make Dark Steel Armor with a Glider attached to it, that's the closest you can get to flight. (Every recipe that needs an Elytra, you get the Elytra back on crafting, the Flight Modifier for the EnvironmentalTech Nano Beacon gives you the Jetpack back, the same is true for the Angel Ring where you get the Jetpack back)"
