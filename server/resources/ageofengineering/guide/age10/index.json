  "The NeoTech Solidifier is capable of turning steel into TechReborn's Refined Iron. This means you can now craft a Machine Frame and start with TechReborn. TechReborn requires EU, RF support is disabled for this pack.",

  "The first goal should be the Industrial Grinder so that you can get additional items from grinding ores. You need a multiblock behind it, 3x3x3 in size, 18 Standard Machine Casings (3x3 on the top and bottom), 8 Reinforced Machine Casings (3x3 hollow in the middle) and a Water Source in the middle. Then you should work towards the Industrial Blast Furnace which needs a 3x3x4 multiblock of Reinforced or Advanced Machine Casings attached (Advanced Machine Casings increase temperature) behind it. Alternatively you can also use the Immersive Engineering Arc Furnace which is a lot faster. Now you can make Titanium (from Bauxite) and Chrome (from Rubies) and advance to the next age (you also need the Electrolyzer).",

  "Later on you also need to make Iridium Ingots. Iridium you get from Sheldonite or Platinum. For Iridium Plates you need an Implosion Compressor. It needs a 3x3x3 multiblock with Standard Machine Casings in the 8 corners and Reinforced Machine Casings in a plus shape on each side (the center is hollow) under it.",

  "To make Tungstensteel you need to have the Blast Furnace with a lot of Advanced Machine Casings to give the right temperature and cool the hot Tungstensteel in a Vaccum Freezer. The Vaccum Freezer needs a 3x3x3 multiblock with 6 Advanced Machine Casings (one in the center on each side) and the rest Reinforced Machine Casings (the center is hollow). Also the Vacuum Freezer needs Ice Shards from bees.",

  "In the late game you can make a Fusion Reactor for what you need 24 additional Fusion Coils which you place in a circle around the Fusion Reactor. Then with a lot of power to prime and Deuterium and Tritium Cells (or Helium3 Cells) you can create a lot of power and is the key to create Heliumplasma."
