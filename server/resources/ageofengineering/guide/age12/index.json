  "After you have Zirconium you can start with Mekanism as the Steel Casing needs Stainless Steel. Mekanism has its own power system in this modpack, Joules. So you need to start with the Heat Generator to generate power and can then work towards Solar, Wind and Bio Power (which are all heavily tweaked). Later you can use the Gas-Burning Generator, the Turbine and the Fusion Reactor for more power. Key things you can achieve with Mekanism are 5x Ore Processing and the Digital Miner, a Quarry which can target blocks. Also HDPE Plastic is something you need later."
