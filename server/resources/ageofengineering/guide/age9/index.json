  "With Mica and End Diamonds, you can now make NeoTech machines which basically enables you to triple your ores for a lot of RF. You need these 3 machines to setup that: Electric Crucible, Centrifuge and Solidifier. With the Thermal Binder you can also make very powerful tools and armor. Now you can make the Quantum Quarry from ExtraUtils2 which has the advantage of never having to move and using Silk Touch or Fortune to it.",

  "Now that you can craft the Thermal Binder, you are able to start with Applied Energistics 2 as the Inscriber needs it.

If you didn't make pure Crystals in advance you can spend some power to make them in the Empowerer until you have Crystal Growth Accelerators. Side note: To get the Ender Pearl Dust for Quantum Entangled Singularities, put Ender Pearls in a Macerator."
