  "Now you can start to think about getting the creative items. The first thing you can get is creative flight with the Angel Ring. The Angel Ring needs grid power, but you can upgrade it to the Wings of the Bats which is cost free flight.",
  null,
  "Then you can start work towards creative RF power with the Creative Capacitor Bank from EnderIO which needs a Chaotic Core for what you need to kill the Chaos Dragon, the most powerful boss in the game. You can also get creative EU power with the Quantum Generator and creative Joules power with the Creative Energy Cube from Mekanism by just exchanging those items in your crafting grid.",
  null,
  "Just fyi: You can put the Atomic Multiplier from Calculator to good use. It replicates items for the cost of 7 circuits and 1.5B RF. Be aware though that some items are blacklisted.",
  null,
  "Next on the list is creative fluids and gasses. For fluids you can craft the Creative Fluid Tank from NeoTech. Just as a side note, producing the five fluids can all be automated and make sure you use a Neotech Wrench to pick the full tanks up. And for gasses you can craft the Creative Gas Tank from Mekanism. (Note the recipe for the Creative Gas Tank is currently not shown correctly in JEI. The Gas Tanks must be filled with Clean Osmium Slurry (top), Hydrogen Chloride (left), Sodium (center), Ethylene (right) and D-T Fuel (bottom)). To set the Creative Gas Tank to a certain gas, you should use a Gauge Dropper.",
  null,
  "The final challenging goal is to get creative items with the Creative Vending Upgrade from Storage Drawers. It's sounds challenging, but you can use your unlimited fluids and gasses to good use to get those items. If you really managed to get the Creative Vending Upgrade, CONGRATS! You've beaten the game. (Make sure you duplicate the Creative Vending Upgrade in your Crafting Grid a couple of times or to make a drawer of Creative Vending Upgrades by inputting with pipes/hopper as those Upgrades are one-use only.)"
